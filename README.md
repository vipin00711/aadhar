# Aadhar Number Validator and Generator
Python script for validating and generating Aadhar card numbers using Verhoeff Algorithm.

File aVaildate.py can be used for validating given Aadhar Number.

File aGenerate.py can be used for generating aadhar numbers.

The numbers are generated using Verhoeff Algorithm so most of the aadhar verification services won't be able to differentiate between legit aadhar numbers and generated numbers and the generated number will be accepted.
e.g. Amazon Pay, etc

Services which cross check aadhar numbers with UIDAI servers will detect the generated aadhar numbers.
e.g. Banks, etc

Also available at Python Package Index

```bash
pip install aadhar
```
